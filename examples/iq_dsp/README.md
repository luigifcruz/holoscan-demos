# Complex I/Q Digital Signal Processing
This demo will create synthetic data and process it using an assortment of Holoscan DSP operators. The generated data can be visualized using CyberEther. For example, the NVIDIA logo is encoded in the IQ stream together with a circle inside a constellation diagram.

## Usage

### 1. Run
```
$ cd examples/iq_dsp
$ ./main
```
This will start the application. The CyberEther interface can be accessed using a local CyberEther instance with the Remote Block. Check out the [CyberEther documentation](https://github.com/luigifcruz/CyberEther?tab=readme-ov-file#remote-interface) for more information. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C`.
